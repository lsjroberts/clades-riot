# Clades

> A clade is a group consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants, a single "branch" on the "tree of life". The ancestor may be an individual, a population or even a species (extinct or extant). Many familiar groups, rodents and insects for example, are clades; others, like lizards and monkeys, are not (lizards excludes snakes, monkeys excludes apes and humans).

### What is the aim of this project?

To provide an interactive resource for studying the relationships between organisms, taxa and clades. It is not designed to provide a full resource of information regarding each entity, just primarily the relationships.

An example use case would be to find how distantly related humans are to another species.

A secondary objective is to provide an API for retrieving this data for developers to use for other projects / tools.

### What about existing projects?

There are several similar existing projects:

- [Catalogue of Life](http://www.catalogueoflife.org/)
- [Tree of Life Web Project](http://www.tolweb.org/)
- [Encyclopedia of Life](http://eol.org/)

This project does not intend to be a definitive or authoritative source of all known species, instead it is aimed towards providing useful and easily accessible information, particularly for laymen.

The existing sources are pretty information dense and geared more toward researchers.

## Development

Built with:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
